# discordbo
A simple use of the discord.py library to create a text bot that will respond to certain messages and has some built in commands. The bot as of now is fairly bare bones but may have added features and functionality later on.
The Bot can also join and leave discord voice chat but requires the user inputting the command to be in the voice channel. The bot does not yet play media.
